To complete the task, download and install Tableau, import the provided daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip file, and create calculated measures for unhealthy statuses. Create bar charts for downtime per factory and downtime per device type. Then, create a dashboard with these charts, set the first chart as a filter, and select the factory with the highest downtime. Take a screenshot of the dashboard and submit it as the task completed. A step-by-step Task Guide PDF is available for assistance.
